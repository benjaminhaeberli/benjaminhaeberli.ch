## Todo-List

### Technical

1. Check if there is a better way to make a field not translatable at all (user fields for example)

```
twitter:
  label: Twitter
  type: text
  icon: twitter
  width: 1/2
  translate: false
```

2. Check if there is a way to define required/mandatory field in blueprint (editing from panel)

### Conception

- Keep this repository as my portfolio only, not dashboard or hub to interact with my customers
- Define later what level of transparency I want to achieve (share prices on my public website, only indications like "start from" or nothing)

#### Portfolio, dashbord and collective

- Decide how I want to build my dashboard : xxx.benjaminhaeberli.ch or a different name, maybe the starting point for my future sustainable-focused collective ?

  - Accept TWINT and credit cards, with an ethical payment providers if possible (see Adyen and Datatrans) -> define how many fees I ask for it and explain it clearly for customers
  - Synchronize hours count (with Clockify one time a week + Limit weekly meetings duration up to 20-45 minutes (depending on the size of the project) -> Additional time is billed separately or deduced from the hours left of the quote.
  - Payment delay is fixed to 20 days -> Customers can ask for an additionnal time from the dashboard (10 days) but need to justified (text box). For any unjustified delay, the project became "Blocked" and I wait to receive the payment and some explanations, naturally. If the delay exceed 14 days, I charge 10% more.
    - I'm aware there is some reasons that can sometime justify delays and that's fine but what I just ask you one thing : Don't book me and accept my offer if you don't have the money to pay it. It doesn't mean we'll never be able to work together ! You can reduce your needs to start with a simpler version first or we can report the development **À PLUS TARD** and we'll both be happier, I swear !
  - On my side, I refuse to send any quote without a detailed **CAHIER DES CHARGES** or if it requires specific tools I've never worked with. I firstly take time with you to discuss about your needs and the context you're evolving in before we get into the technical aspects of your project. It's the time we set up a common language that will allow us to communicate easily about the project with an underestimated clarity.
  - An **ACOMPTE** of 50% is asked before I start to work, and 50% left when project is done. "Done" means you can access it and see by yourselve I completed all the needs described in the **CAHIER DES CHARGES**.
    - For long-time projects exceding 20 hours of work or which will take more than one month to achieve (from quote signature to the end of the final step), my work is billed two times a month, **AU PRORATA DE LA PROGRESSION**

- Annuaire de réseau comme Noeysa
- Formulaire Tally sur la plateforme, centralisation des liens (kDrive, channel Element), contrats et factures (exportés depuis Bexio et/ou SwissSign), suivi du projet (statut, % d'avancement, journal des heures importé de Clockify, etc).
